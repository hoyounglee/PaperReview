# Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows

## Abstract
- This new vision transformer capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision
- The auhtor proposes hierarchical transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows for solving main challenges of previous transformer which are **large variations in the scale of visual entities** and **hight resolution of pixels in images**.
- Shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by **limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows**.
