# Object Detection Overview

## Object Detection
### Definition
> Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. 
> With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene
> and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them.

### Difference from Classification
> Classification task looks for the 'class' of the target scene. The model can only output a **single** class name from a single image.
> However, object detection can find the location of the objects along with the class name of them. Besides, object detector can find **multiple** object's locations and class
> from a single image (multi object detection)

## Overall process of Object Detection
- single stage detector vs two stage detector
