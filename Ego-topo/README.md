## Background
### Scene understanding [[ref](https://alexgkendall.com/media/presentations/2019_icvss_sicily_kendall.pdf)]
“Scene understanding is to analyze a scene by considering the geometric and semantic context of its contents and the intrinsic relationships between them.” [Indoor Scene Understanding in 2.5/3D: A Survey. Naseer et al. 2018.]

In this paper,
scene understanding is largely about answering the who/where/what questions of recognition: what objects are present? is it an indoor/outdoor scene? where is the person and what are they doing?
